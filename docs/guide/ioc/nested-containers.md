is specific to the scope of that operation and is should not live on outside of that scope.

You probably won't directly interact with nested containers, but do note that they are used behind the scenes at runtime of basically every
popular application framework in .Net these days (ASP.Net Core, NServiceBus, MassTransit, NancyFx, you name it).
